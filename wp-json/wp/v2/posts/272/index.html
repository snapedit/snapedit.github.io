Here are some common causes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c1\">-Camera shake: When the camera is subject to vibration or shock during photography, the image may be blurred. This usually happens when taking pictures in low light or using a long shooting time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c1\">-Insufficient light: When the light is low, the camera will have to use a longer shooting time to get enough light. As a result, images may become blurred due to subject or camera movement during shooting.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c1\">-Low resolution: When the image has a low resolution, the details in the image will not be reproduced correctly, resulting in loss of clarity and blurring.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c1\">-Image quality error: Some technical or hardware failures on the camera can lead to blurry photos. These errors may be related to the image sensor, lens, or other components that cause blurry images<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c11\">\u00a0 \u00a0To fix blurry photos, you can use image editing tools like\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c3\">SnapEdit<\/span><span class=\"c1\">\u00a0to sharpen, increase contrast, and adjust other parameters to improve image quality.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h.q85hxb9n4u3b\" class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c13\">How to fix blurry photos with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c13\">SnapEdit ?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"c7\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/txGq5kEwoXSau17_HgbGXNLJX0cctYgxqcxPkKLJolK1rcOFjdaoqZWVX2kQW8FDXyPalyRHlH60xHxZsMmhKw-dZk4po2h2sbhNNPF0-Q885lueJX3yd9NiP9rkd9AlsE4ix9Jxt-n1rQ1ggZrrHw.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"c16\"><span class=\"c18\">SnapEdit&#8217;s interface<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c11\">&#8211;<\/span><span class=\"c11\">First access the SnapEdit browser: Open a web browser and access the address of the SnapEdit browser.<\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0<\/span><strong><span class=\"c3 c6\">https:\/\/snapedit.app\/enhance<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c1\">Make sure you are connected to the internet and have a web browser installed on your device.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c1\">-Upload a photo to SnapEdit: On the main SnapEdit page, you&#8217;ll see an option to upload a photo.
