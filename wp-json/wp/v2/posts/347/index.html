People often take pictures of famous landscapes, and most of the time those places are too crowded. A messy, crowded background can be irritating and in the past, removing unwanted objects in photos has been a tedious and time-consuming task involving spending hours scrubbing pixel after pixel with Photoshop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2 c6\">However, with the recent explosion in AI advancements, cleaning up photos to look more professional &amp; beautiful has become much more efficient and accessible than ever before. In this post, we will comb through a few notable websites that offer this function (for free!). With them, hopefully you will never have to worry about being photobombed again.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h.bgndqyaqiz45\" class=\"c9 c20\"><span class=\"c6 c17\">Challenges of cleaning up photos with traditional methods<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c6 c2\">Previously, the main method of removing objects in photos consisted of cropping, erasing, and patching. While they can be effective, they require a lot of time, skill, and experience to achieve the desired results. The task multiplies in complexity when faced with multiple people and objects to remove.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c6 c2\">AI-powered tools for object removal have revolutionized the way we approach photo editing. These tools use machine learning algorithms to analyze the image and identify unwanted objects. Then, they replace the object with a seamless background that matches the surrounding pixels. This process is much faster and more efficient than traditional methods, and it produces consistent results with minimal effort. All it left for you to do is choose the right tools to make use of AI technology to remove objects and make your favorite photos perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h.p613ck7tnajo\" class=\"c20 c9\">3 Online Tools to Remove Unwanted Objects<\/h2>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c6 c2\">There are many effective tools available for removing objects in photos, ranging from basic software features to more advanced editing applications.

Of course, this feature is a hard-one to get right, however I think that it\u2019s effective around 4 out of 5 times testing. You can also compare the edited image with the original and make changes with the\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c2 c5\">Brush\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c2\">option if needed<\/span><span class=\"c6 c2\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YasCGg8Ld283on_Qz-tdlI-rN5KTGq946m8FPSdooNz5DbWwILnJoIhEG16ZmERFgguQLkFr8loCtsZuWMSg8V-jNKilOtcO9T-PuurKQDPpub2vxLhPpKk1X-ymBV2qNZ6N6KCLOTIOuvVvVLtwjg.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">As you can see from the sample picture above, the\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c2 c5\">AutoAI<\/span><span class=\"c6 c2\">\u00a0function actually understands that this photo is more likely an attempt to capture the landscape and therefore does not necessarily require a main subject.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"c2 c5\">Step 3:\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c2\">See and adjust result<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/eG-mhk0Z2IdHWIjVoCBBB1e9aiIpSLvYohMC1RkfqVFCO7mZR7byz4cC-RAaQu0C5mqWx_e7-FTu0f6cy9S2XBFAsexjjGmZX4Z0pojwZbFa-9dOsXuC_GZ3lcQeq3MEnkuyo9eGefVdG7ABvKNvGQ.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">The result is good but not perfect just yet.

Much like its name, the website focuses entirely on removing any unwanted details from images. This includes: objects, people, texts, defects that it may have found in your photos. Cleanup focuses on more in-depth use cases of editing out image details such as for ecommerce photography, creative agencies, removing logos\/watermarks for more efficient workflow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c6 c8\">In order to use it, simply open the Cleanup.pictures website and upload your photo in the same way as SnapEdit (most photo editing web apps work the same way for convenience sake).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/0DnqEUHudPeqx0mff-78e1REDZEX5wby5ASoxsX64lTmpI_yynMJ_UzDPuWW8aPMArSdKNaQwtvBpPHxpdMezHR305-AaoFA3-dIR7dAyqVfkLa2HL1lECp0AJoGdzURhFZYxJF8_lCW2RV6kXHh8w.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/8E0OFOyIhmHzo7BaBPET5BCZ-Z90eDAZWLHMzdo9hoIr3VG_bI264MAHres3O5PdD73XOutTWcwNHhzrXV5Cy9KCab4Ct71RNHadAKv3n_17kywWopcjBwAZb9VuF7LPh9yO5zxJOk5CSu5-sDGmg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"795\" height=\"530\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\">Testing Cleanup on this relatively simple photo, we can see that it does a decent job removing the 3 main subjects in the photo (leaving the landscape). However, blurry patches remained behind which does not appear to improve with further\u00a0<span class=\"c5\">Brush\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c6 c8\">edit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\">CleanUp currently only offers the choice to download the edited image in Standard Definition (low resolution &amp; auto-compressed) &#8211; you can choose to upgrade to its Premium version.<\/p>\n<ol class=\"c10 lst-kix_hzesxq8ulu9v-0\" start=\"3\">\n<li class=\"c7 li-bullet-0\">\n<h3 id=\"h.dun1t9cbil5q\"><span class=\"c16\">PicWish<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"c3\">PicWish is another popular app to remove unwanted objects.

Blemishes are hard to spot and there are no noticeable color mismatches.<\/p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c6 c2\">In conclusion, removing unwanted objects in photos is no longer a challenge thanks to modern technology and software. When choosing a method for deleting objects, it&#8217;s important to consider the size and complexity of the object, as well as the surrounding background. By using the right tools and techniques, anyone can create high-quality photos that are free of unneeded details.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Photography has always been about capturing the essence of a moment, but sometimes unwanted objects&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":351,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/347"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=347"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/347\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":358,"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/347\/revisions\/358"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/351"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=347"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=347"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=347"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
