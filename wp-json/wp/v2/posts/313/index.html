AI-powered tools provide us with powerful capabilities and creative possibilities to edit and enhance photos. These tools leverage the computational power of AI to analyze and manipulate images, making the editing process more efficient, intuitive, and visually stunning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c6\">Traditionally, editing objects, people and unwanted details out of images required tedious and sometimes very complex manual work. Because of the immense need for taking photos and thus the need for editing photos, companies have been repeatedly coming up with AI-driven photo editing tools that aim to reduce time-consuming laboring and make photo editing accessible for users with little to no photography knowledge. Today, we are going to look at two examples of such tools &#8211; SnapEdit &amp; Cleanup Pictures. We are going to look at only the web-based version of these tools as they also usually have a mobile app \u00a0on iOS and Android.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Both of these tools can be used for free on their websites with some minor caveats. However, testing done by us has shown that they perform well without the need for a Premium upgrade. Let\u2019s dive in!<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h.tf0bpnjhe5jf\"><span class=\"c19\">SNAPEDIT<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c6\"><a href=\"https:\/\/snapedit.app\/\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>SnapEdit.APP<\/strong><\/span><\/em><\/a> is one of the 2 tools we choose for this article since it\u2019s one of the few editing app with a good and optimized web version. Taking a look at SnapEdit\u2019 homepage, we can immediately see the varied functionalities and clean UI\/UX it provides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/VKTtn13RNFrYu-HcAJfmZxhyeosk2YwIl_cDPb9nH04vx5l0a0KFz5T8yb8ZyHHq84Y0g5Z-PwOLK9skF7OQ21viMphcDkk1dGsX7wLtOt9H7c1bn7P3W8XZVOjS90eZFPSq2MYKAJR_6ZzqZnHQlg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"829\" height=\"577\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c7\">Using Snapedit&#8217;s object removal feature is as easy as a few taps on your screen thanks to\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c15\">Auto-AI<\/span><span class=\"c6\">. The app will automatically identify objects in the photo, so all you need to do is select the object you want to remove and let Snapedit&#8217;s advanced AI algorithms work their magic. Within moments, the object seamlessly disappears, leaving behind a clean and polished image that looks like it was never there in the first place. Let\u2019s test it on an image first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Q0JG_tajG0OaXjjZh-AcKqK9VaPhqT5iIaay7ATsVJb2vcAzdHOPNLhAsRTZy3ZPyfgW_d8jzhuhf9FW08OTUgjq9R-VFh0_priqPbHisMq4i-cMoyWVp4NBsywH51bjAEvfnCXFtAA08UMkowx4Vw.jpg\" alt=\"Original test image (relatively simple example)\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"c10\"><span class=\"c6\">Original test image (relatively simple example)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c7\">Using the AutoAI feature, the app suggest removing these details colored in red:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/tool.downtik.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/K5oKp44ikh9N4eCQbvJHpcMPWv1GUHDrsXcbpCta2kmb_uiSTdyAivX2EYMGy08DhdQoKsA_HBENIMXTyACHEOHafZY-W0lrJuR_90extxk0_wnc3F-aBIBFUVGIAsWwxrL4znNY6-QDa_pkZYqeLQ.jpg\" alt=\"AutoAI suggestions for objects that should be removed\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c7\">First thing I noticed was that it very accurately determines what is the main subject and what can be removed for a more personal photo.
