<p>In today&#8217;s digital era, showcasing your products effectively is crucial for success in the online marketplace. Whether you&#8217;ve created your own products or curated a collection, setting up a website and claiming your social media profiles are just the beginning. To truly connect with your audience and drive sales, you need captivating product photography. However, the task of photographing products is often accompanied by the need to master the art of editing product images – removing backgrounds, enhancing lighting, adding shadows, and more. For small business owners juggling multiple responsibilities, this can seem daunting.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s a solution that can save you time and money while ensuring your product images look their best – AI product photography tools. These tools are designed to simplify the image editing process and eliminate the need for expensive photography and image editing services.</p>
<p>Not sure where to start with these tools? You&#8217;re in the right place. In this article, we&#8217;ll introduce you to a range of free and cost-effective AI photo editing tools created by PhotoRoom, which will empower you to edit product images effortlessly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<p><strong>How to Edit Product Images for Your Small Business in 7 Quick Steps</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you have a small business specializing in handmade ceramics. You need high-quality images to showcase your products on your website, social media, and email campaigns, but you also have budget constraints.</p>
<p>&#8220;PhotoRoom is an essential tool,&#8221; says Ane Howard, founder of Faba Collection. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a photography budget to afford $10,000 per month, plus models – that&#8217;s even on the low end of minimum costs. PhotoRoom is much more affordable and gives my purses a high-end luxury look by elevating my photography.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether you want to edit product images one by one or save time by editing up to 50 images at a time using PhotoRoom&#8217;s batch editing feature, follow these steps to create beautiful, realistic product pictures that can enhance customer engagement and boost sales.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Take Product Photos</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, you need to capture images of your products. Thanks to AI product photography tools like PhotoRoom, you don&#8217;t need to stress over setting up the perfect background or lighting. All you need is your smartphone. Simply upload your product photos and use a variety of AI photo editing tools to enhance them. In the following steps, you&#8217;ll discover everything you can do to create high-quality, lifelike product images in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Remove Unwanted Objects from Photos</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, you may want to eliminate specific objects during the product image editing process. If so, start by using the Magic Retouch tool. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Snapedit App</strong> (available on Google, Apple, or the web).</li>
<li>Select &#8216;Retouch.&#8217;</li>
<li>Choose a product photo from your library.</li>
<li>Use your finger to rub over the object you want to remove.</li>
<li>Click &#8216;Next.&#8217;</li>
<li>Click the &#8216;Export&#8217; button.</li>
<li>Save the edited image to your device.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve removed unwanted objects, you can upload the new product photo and continue editing, including background removal, lighting adjustments, and shadow enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Remove the Background and Choose a New One</strong></p>
<p>Background distractions can divert your customers&#8217; attention away from your products. However, manually <a href="https://snapedit.app/remove-bg"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>remove bg</strong></span></em></a> and replacing it with a new, realistic one using software like Photoshop or Figma can be time-consuming. That&#8217;s where the Instant Backgrounds AI tool comes in, saving you time and frustration. Use this tool to create minimalist or fun backgrounds suitable for small business promotions on social media or product photos on your website.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the PhotoRoom app.</li>
<li>Click &#8216;Start from Photo.&#8217;</li>
<li>Select an image from your library (for this example, let&#8217;s use the one we removed an object from).</li>
<li>Watch the background disappear.</li>
<li>On the next screen, click &#8216;Instant Backgrounds.&#8217;</li>
<li>Choose from existing templates or click the pencil tool (top right) to type in a prompt for a custom AI-generated scene.</li>
<li>Click &#8216;Generate 4 more&#8217; until you find the background you like.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#8220;Different template themes are great for lifestyle shots,&#8221; says Ian Nethercot, a satisfied PhotoRoom user and founder of Switchup Signs. &#8220;They bring my products to life so customers can visualize them in their space, creating an emotional connection.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust the Lighting and Add Shadows</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve selected a new background (either a template or a custom AI-generated one), you can fine-tune elements such as lighting, shadows, brightness, warmth, and more. Follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the two lines next to &#8216;Product&#8217; on the right side.</li>
<li>Select &#8216;Light On&#8217; (this enhances product lighting without affecting the rest of the image).</li>
<li>Scroll down to choose other editing features, such as adding a shadow or adjusting the brightness or warmth of the photo.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For studio-style images with a solid background, Backdrop templates can be used to generate backgrounds that already have shadows.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Text to Product Images</strong></p>
<p>While not all photos require text, adding your company name to product photos or incorporating text to promote giveaways or sales on platforms like Instagram can help build brand awareness. Here&#8217;s how you can do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the &#8216;Text&#8217; button to choose from a variety of PhotoRoom fonts and styles.</li>
<li>Alternatively, click the &#8216;Font&#8217; button to select your own font.</li>
<li>Click on &#8216;Look&#8217; to resize the text.</li>
<li>While on the &#8216;Look&#8217; screen, scroll down to adjust the color, alignment, shadow, outline, and position of the text (move it to the front or back).</li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage, you can either export the photo or proceed to the image resizing step (covered next).</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Utilize PhotoRoom&#8217;s Sales templates to transform your product photos into compelling sales promotions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Resize Product Photos</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re satisfied with your background, lighting, and other product image edits, you can resize the product photo to fit your website, email campaigns, or social media platforms. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the &#8216;Resize&#8217; button.</li>
<li>Choose from templates such as square, landscape, and portrait, or opt for custom settings.</li>
<li>Adjust the photo to fit the new image size. For example, if you choose the Landscape option, which may cut off the top of the photo, drag the product photo back into the new layout so that the promotional text remains visible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When using the mobile app (available on Google or Apple), employ one of PhotoRoom&#8217;s size templates to resize your product photos for platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Shopify, Etsy, Amazon, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Export Edited Product Images</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed the product image editing process, click the export button (located in the top right corner) to save your product photos to your device or export them directly to your preferred marketplace or social network.</p>
